Alert Generation System – Class Diagram Explanation
The Alert Generation System monitors patient data and triggers alerts when a patient’s health values cross critical thresholds.
The main class, AlertGenerator, checks incoming patient data using information from the DataStorage class, which stores all patient records in the system.
Each patient is represented by a Patient object, which keeps a list of PatientRecord objects.
These PatientRecord objects store individual measurements, such as heart rate or blood pressure, together with a timestamp.
When the AlertGenerator detects that a value is outside the safe range for a patient, it creates an Alert object containing the patient ID, the condition that triggered the alert, and the time it happened (timestamp).
The alert is then sent to the AlertManager.
In the diagram, AlertGenerator is connected to both DataStorage (for accessing patient data) and AlertManager (for sending alerts).
AlertManager manages a collection of Alert objects, while DataStorage manages all Patient objects, and each Patient manages their own PatientRecord objects.
This design keeps responsibilities clear and separated: data is stored and retrieved by DataStorage, alerts are created by AlertGenerator, and managed by AlertManager.
