Patient Identification System – Class Diagram Explanation
The Patient Identification System manages how every patient in the CHMS is uniquely identified and how their medical records are organized.
The main class, Patient, stores a unique patient ID and a list of medical records (PatientRecord).
Each PatientRecord contains details about a specific measurement, such as the type, value, and timestamp.
It’s s linked to a patient by their ID.
The DataStorage class keeps track of all patients in the system, making it possible to add new data, retrieve records for a specific patient, and get a list of all patients.
To manage and verify patient identities, the IdentityManager class maintains a collection of registered patients and provides methods to register new patients, find patients by ID, and authenticate them.
The PatientIdentifier class is responsible for generating and validating unique patient IDs, following specific rules.
The Staff class represents medical staff who can access patient data and authenticate themselves in the system.
The diagram shows aggregation between DataStorage and Patient, and between Patient and PatientRecord, as well as between IdentityManager and Patient.
There are also associations between Staff and IdentityManager, and between PatientIdentifier and Patient.
