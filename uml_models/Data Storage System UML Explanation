Data Storage System â€“ Class Diagram Explanation

The Data Storage System is responsible for securely storing and organizing all patient health data in the CHMS.
The main class, DataStorage, keeps a map of all patients, each identified by a unique patient ID.
Each Patient object contains a list of PatientRecord objects, which store single health measurements (like heart rate or blood pressure) with a timestamp and type.
Data is added to the system using the addPatientData method in DataStorage.
If a patient does not exist yet, a new Patient object is created.
Patient records can be retrieved for a specific patient and time range using the getRecords method.
The DataReader interface allows different ways to bring new data into the system, such as from files or network sources.
For queries and analysis, the DataRetriever class provides methods to search for records by patient or time range, and to list all patients.
It also supports access control with an accessLevel attribute, so only authorized users can view or change data.
The diagram shows aggregation between DataStorage and Patient, and between Patient and PatientRecord, meaning each storage contains many patients, and each patient has many records.
Associations connect DataReader and DataRetriever to DataStorage.
